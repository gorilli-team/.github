## üìú The Gorilli Manifesto

The Gorilli Manifesto is a declaration of our principles and intentions as a collective of passionate web3 developers. We are united by a shared vision of leveraging the power of hackathons to create and showcase cutting-edge Proof-of-Concepts. Our strength lies in our ability to rapidly and effectively scale a product, a testament to our agility, innovation, and dedication to the evolving world of web3. As Gorilli, we commit to pushing boundaries, fostering collaboration, and delivering disruptive solutions that shape the future of decentralized technology.

In the continuation of the Gorilli Manifesto, we pledge to maintain an open mind, continuously learning and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of decentralized technologies. Our dedication to innovation drives us to explore new horizons, and we thrive on the thrill of turning ideas into reality. We also recognize the importance of collaboration in the web3 space, and we actively seek partnerships that promote mutual growth and learning.

We believe that our commitment to these principles will contribute significantly to the web3 community. By staying true to our manifesto, we aim to inspire others and make a lasting impact on the future of decentralized technology. As Gorilli, we are not just developers; we are pioneers, innovators, and leaders in our field.

We build, explore, trash, improve, scale.

We take the initiative to construct and develop, venturing into new territories and ideas. We are not afraid to discard what doesn't work, constantly seeking improvement. Once we have refined our ideas, we then focus on expanding and scaling for greater impact.

We take the initiative to construct and develop, venturing into unknown territories and experimenting with innovative ideas. We embrace failure as a part of the process, accepting that some concepts may need to be scrapped in our pursuit of excellence. Driven by our insatiable curiosity, we constantly seek to improve, refining our concepts and techniques until they are honed to perfection.

Once our concepts have been refined and optimized, our focus shifts to scaling. We strive to broaden the reach of our projects, expanding them to touch as many lives as possible. This process of scaling is not merely about growth; it's about amplifying the impact of our work, contributing to the web3 community in significant and meaningful ways.

As we journey through this cycle of building, exploring, discarding, improving, and scaling, we remain committed to our manifesto. We continue to push boundaries and break new ground, committed to our role as pioneers in the field of decentralized technology. With every project, we aim to inspire, disrupt, and shape the future of web3.

**Let‚Äôs Go! Really!**
